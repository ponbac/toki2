# Toki2 üïí

A Milltime and Azure DevOps integration platform built with Rust and React. Initially built because I wanted to try out Rust _(this is an excuse for the code quality)_.

## Overview

Toki2 helps you manage your time entries, track pull requests, and stay notified about important updates in Azure DevOps.

## Features

- ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard friendly

  - CMD+K menu to quickly navigate to different sections, start timer, etc.

  - Pull Request tracking: see all your PRs across different projects and organizations in one place.
  - Work item integration: generate Milltime notes based on connected work items.

- ‚è±Ô∏è Time Tracking

  - Instant sync with Milltime, no more syncing at the end of the week

  - Ability to track entire repositories, or individual PRs
