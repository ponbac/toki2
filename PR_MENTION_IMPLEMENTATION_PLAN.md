# PR Mention Implementation Plan

## Overview

Adding functionality to notify users when they are mentioned in a pull request comment.

## Current Architecture Understanding

- `PRChangeEvent` enum handles different types of PR changes
- `DbNotificationType` enum maps to database notification types
- Comments already have mention detection via `Comment::mentions()` method
- Notification system uses rules and exceptions for per-user/repo settings
- RepoDiffer compares old vs new PR states to detect changes

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Migration âœ…

- [x] Analyze current notification_type enum (pr_closed, thread_added, thread_updated)
- [x] Create new migration to add 'comment_mentioned' to notification_type enum

### 2. Rust Type Updates âœ…

- [x] Identify DbNotificationType enum location
- [x] Add CommentMentioned variant to DbNotificationType
- [x] Add CommentMentioned(Thread, Comment) variant to PRChangeEvent

### 3. Event Detection Logic âœ…

- [x] Update PullRequest::changelog() to detect new mentions
- [x] Compare old vs new comments to find new mentions
- [x] Filter mentions to only notify the mentioned user

### 4. Notification Handling âœ…

- [x] Update NotificationHandler match statement for new event type
- [x] Add applies_to() logic for mention events
- [x] Add push notification formatting for mentions

### 5. Frontend Integration âœ…

- [x] Update TypeScript types to include new notification type
- [x] Ensure UI handles the new notification type

## Technical Implementation Details

### Files to Modify:

1. `toki-api/migrations/` - New migration file
2. `toki-api/src/domain/notification_preference.rs` - Add enum variant
3. `toki-api/src/domain/pr_change_event.rs` - Add enum variant and logic
4. `toki-api/src/domain/pull_request.rs` - Update changelog detection
5. `toki-api/src/domain/notification_handler.rs` - Handle new event type
6. `app/src/lib/api/mutations/notifications.ts` - Update TS types

### Key Design Decisions:

- Store both Thread and Comment in the event for context
- Only notify when a user is newly mentioned (not re-mentioned)
- Follow existing pattern for applies_to() logic
- Mentions should only apply to the mentioned user, not PR author

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Database & Types âœ…

- [x] Create migration
- [x] Update DbNotificationType
- [x] Update PRChangeEvent

### Phase 2: Detection Logic âœ…

- [x] Implement mention detection in changelog
- [x] Add mention comparison logic

### Phase 3: Notification System âœ…

- [x] Update notification handler
- [x] Add push notification formatting
- [x] Test end-to-end flow

### Phase 4: Testing & Integration âœ…

- [x] Test with real Azure DevOps data
- [x] Verify notification rules work correctly
- [x] Update frontend types if needed

## Implementation Complete! ðŸŽ‰

**CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Fixed mention detection logic to properly resolve user IDs to email addresses (originally was incorrectly comparing IDs with emails).

The PR mention functionality has been successfully implemented with the following features:

- **Database Migration**: Added `comment_mentioned` notification type to the database
- **Backend Logic**: New `PRChangeEvent::CommentMentioned` variant detects when users are mentioned in comments
- **Notification System**: Users get notified when mentioned, with proper filtering to avoid self-notifications
- **Frontend Integration**: Updated TypeScript types and UI components to handle mention notifications
- **User Settings**: Users can configure notification preferences for mentions just like other notification types

## Usage

Users will now receive notifications when they are mentioned in pull request comments using the `@<user>` syntax. The system:

1. Detects new comments with mentions when PRs are updated
2. Creates `CommentMentioned` events for each mentioned user
3. Applies user notification rules and PR-specific exceptions
4. Sends both in-app and push notifications (if enabled)
5. Shows mention notifications with a purple @ icon in the UI

The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing notification system and respects all user preferences.
