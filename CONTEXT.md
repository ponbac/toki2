# Toki

Toki is a provider-agnostic time tracking and development workflow platform.

## Language

**Automation API**:
The curated HTTP surface published to agents through the generated OpenAPI document. Runtime bearer authentication is composed independently and may cover routes outside this catalog.
_Avoid_: public API, MCP API, agent gateway

**Agent operation**:
One HTTP method and path in the Automation API, identified by a stable operation ID. An endpoint becomes an agent operation only by being listed in the curated OpenAPI document.
_Avoid_: tool, endpoint (when referring to this catalog specifically)

**API token**:
An opaque personal credential (`toki_...`) that authenticates a caller as a Toki user over HTTP bearer. The plaintext secret is shown once at issuance; only a hash is stored.
_Avoid_: PAT, access token, session cookie

**Capability**:
A durable permission stored on an API token that narrows the Automation API for that credential. Session users are not capability-checked.
_Avoid_: scope, role, permission (when referring to token grants)

**Active timer**:
The single in-progress time-tracking interval for a user, if any.
_Avoid_: running entry, current registration
